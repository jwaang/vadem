## Intro Message (to text/DM friends)

> Hey! I've been building an app called Vadem — it's basically a care manual you can create for anyone watching your home or pets while you're away. Think of it as replacing the chaotic text threads and Google Docs you send sitters.
>
> I'd love your honest feedback. This quick survey takes about 5 minutes — there's a link to try the app inside. No sugar-coating needed, brutal honesty helps the most!
