# Vadem

> Vadem is a free web app that lets pet owners and homeowners create care manuals for their sitters and share them via a single link. No app download needed for sitters.

## About

Vadem replaces scattered text threads, Google Docs, and sticky notes with a single, structured care manual your sitter opens in any browser. You build it once and reuse it every time you travel.

The target user is a pet-owning homeowner who travels 2-6 times per year and leaves their pets or home with a friend, family member, or hired sitter. Vadem solves the recurring problem of sitters not knowing where things are, missing feeding times, or not having access to important codes and contacts.

Vadem is free during early access. It works on any device with a browser. Sitters never need to create an account.

## How It Works

1. **Create your manual**: Add your property details, pet profiles, care instructions, location photos, emergency contacts, and secure codes through a guided wizard.
2. **Set up a trip**: Add trip dates, any trip-specific instructions (temporary medication changes, scheduled visitors, one-time tasks), and register your sitter by name and phone number.
3. **Share one link**: Send the link via text, email, or any messaging app. Your sitter opens it and sees a "today view" with only what's relevant right now.

The manual is permanent and reusable. Each trip adds a temporary overlay for anything that's different that week, which auto-expires when the trip ends.

## Features

**Pet Profiles**
Rich, structured profiles for each pet including photo, breed, age, feeding instructions (what, how much, when, where food is stored), medications with dosage and schedule, vet info (tap-to-call), personality notes, behavioral quirks, walking routine, allergies, and comfort items. Each field can have an attached location photo showing where things are.

**Daily Task Checklists**
Time-slotted tasks for morning, afternoon, evening, and any-time. Sitters check off tasks as they complete them. Owners see a real-time activity feed with timestamps. Optional photo proof of task completion for accountability.

**Location Cards**
Photo cards attached to any instruction showing exactly where things are. Polaroid-style with short captions. Solves the "where is the dog food?" problem. Examples: photo of the pill bottle on the kitchen counter, photo of the circuit breaker in the basement, photo of the spare key under the fake rock.

**Encrypted Vault**
Secure storage for sensitive credentials: door codes, alarm codes, WiFi passwords, gate codes, garage codes, safe combinations. Encrypted end-to-end on the user's device with AES-256-GCM before being stored. Sitters verify via SMS to decrypt. Access auto-expires when the trip ends. Owners are notified with a timestamp every time a code is accessed. One-click revoke at any time.

**Emergency Contacts**
Always one tap away. Owner phone, partner, veterinarian, emergency neighbor, poison control (pre-filled with ASPCA number), and local non-emergency police. Tap-to-call on mobile.

**Trip Overlays**
Temporary trip-specific instructions layered on top of the permanent manual. Unusual feeding schedules, medication changes, scheduled visitors, temporary house rules, one-time tasks. Visually distinct so the sitter knows what's specific to this trip. Auto-expires on the trip end date.

**Offline Access**
After the first visit, everything (instructions, photos, pet profiles, contacts) is cached for offline access via service worker. Only vault codes require an internet connection for security.

**Real-Time Activity Feed**
Owners see when tasks are completed, when vault codes are accessed, and when proof photos are uploaded. Push notifications configurable per task type.
